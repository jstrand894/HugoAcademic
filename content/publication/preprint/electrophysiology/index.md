abstract: |
  The wheat stem sawfly (WSS), <i>Cephus cinctus</i> Norton, is a major pest of cultivated wheat
  (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) and other cereals in North America. The native congeneric parasitoids
  <i>Bracon cephi</i> and <i>B. lissogaster</i> are important biocontrol agents and play a crucial role in
  managing WSS outbreaks and damage. Smooth brome grass (<i>Bromus inermis</i> Leyss.) has been
  found to be an effective.... <a href="https://doi.org" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">read more</a>
  

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: |
  This study highlights the role of smooth brome grass as a host refuge for the wheat stem sawfly parasitoids, demonstrating its potential to support high infestation rates while promoting significant larval mortality, thus contributing to the sustainability of wheat cultivation in Montana.
