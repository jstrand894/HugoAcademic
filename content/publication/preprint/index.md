abstract: |
  Wheat stem sawfly (WSS), Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), is a major pest of cereal crops throughout the Northern Great Plains of North America. Native parasitoids, Bracon cephi (Gahan) and B. lissogaster Muesebeck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), play a key role in suppressing WSS populations and limiting associated damage. Smooth brome grass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) serves as a potential trap reservoir for WSS when grown in areas surrounding wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fields in Montana. Its unique biology allows it to support high WSS infestation while promoting significant larval mortality throughout the growing season. Late-season WSS survivors can then serve as hosts for WSS parasitoids. Our study investigated smooth brome as a host refuge for WSS parasitoids. We measured WSS larval infestation and survival rate inside smooth brome grown within WSS-inclusion cages, finding a maximum infestation of 66.5% and an end-of-year WSS survival of 5.7%. Additionally, we collected stems from sites in central and north-central Montana to measure the WSS infestation and parasitoid prevalence in wheat and adjacent smooth brome. WSS infestation was high in both Big Sandy (64.5% smooth brome, 65.7% adjacent wheat) and Moccasin, MT (50.6%, 38.6%). Year-end WSS larval mortality was 43.6% greater in smooth brome compared to adjacent wheat at both field sites, but both hosted similar numbers of WSS parasitoids. This research underscores the importance of smooth brome in providing a sustainable host refuge for WSS parasitoids and highlights its significant role in supporting the economics of wheat cultivation.
