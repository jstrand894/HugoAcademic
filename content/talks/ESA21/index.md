summary: Presented a 10-minute paper presentation on my work titled "Comparing use of wheat stem sawfly larvae infesting winter wheat and smooth brome by two braconid parasitoid species in Montana."

abstract: 'Wheat stem sawfly, <i>Cephus cinctus</i> Norton (WSS), causes significant damage in cereal crops throughout the Northern Great Plains of North America. Two parasitoids, <i>Bracon cephi</i> Gahan and <i>B. lissogaster</i> Muesebeck are important factors in suppressing WSS outbreaks and reducing crop damage. Smooth Brome (<i>Bromus inermis</i> L.) has been found to be an effective WSS sink, and may be a potential trap crop, when grown near wheat fields; therefore, we hypothesize that smooth brome emits a similar volatile signature to that of wheat, leading to high levels of oviposition by WSS and, successively, parasitoids. The objective of this study will be to compare oviposition preference and selection behavior of WSS and WSS parasitoids, measure the subsequent survival rates, and compare electroantennogram responses of WSS parasitoids to smooth brome and wheat volatiles. We will compare infestation, parasitism, and larval development of WSS and WSS parasitoids in smooth brome and wheat using both greenhouse-grown plants and field transects of smooth brome and adjacent wheat fields in Montana. Using electroantennography, we will compare the response of WSS and WSS parasitoids to synthetic smooth brome and winter wheat volatile compounds matching those released by plants infested with WSS.'
