abstract: |
  The wheat stem sawfly (WSS), <i>Cephus cinctus</i> Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), poses a
  serious threat to cereal crops across the Northern Great Plains of North America. Effective
  management of WSS relies on native parasitoids <i>Bracon cephi</i> (Gahan) and <i>B. lissogaster</i>
  Muesebeck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), which play a crucial role in suppressing WSS
  populations. Smooth brome grass (<i>Bromus inermis</i> Leyss.), when grown adjacent to wheat
  (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) fields, serves as a potential trap crop that can both reduce WSS larvae and
  provide refuge for parasitoids. However, the agroecological benefits of smooth brome in
  providing second-generation hosts to <i>B. cephi</i> and <i>B. lissogaster</i> are not well understood.
  Therefore, our study explores the ecological dynamics involving WSS, smooth brome, winter
  wheat, emitted volatile compounds, and the associated parasitoids. We analyzed volatile organic
  compounds (VOCs) emitted by WSS-infested smooth brome and winter wheat using EAD-GC-
  FID techniques. Smooth brome under WSS infestation produced higher concentrations of (<i>Z</i>)-3-
  hexenyl acetate, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and (<i>E</i>)-2-hexenal. Both <i>B. cephi</i> and <i>B. lissogaster</i>
  were more attracted to WSS-induced volatile blends from smooth brome when given the choice
  against winter wheat. Field observations were conducted in central and northern Montana to
  assess the efficacy of smooth brome as a host refuge. We recorded WSS infestation rates and
  parasitoid prevalence in smooth brome and adjacent wheat fields. Infestation rates were notably
  high in both crop and adjacent brome fields (e.g., 64.5% in smooth brome and 65.7% in adjacent
  wheat in Big Sandy, Montana). Smooth brome had a maximum WSS larval survival of 5.7% and
  a 43.6% greater larval mortality rate compared to adjacent wheat. With similar parasitoid
  numbers in infested stems, smooth brome effectively reduced WSS survival and provided a
  sustainable habitat for crucial second-generation parasitoids. Based on our findings, we suggest
  the strategic conservation and maintenance of smooth brome in areas located adjacent to
  cultivated wheat fields to better manage populations of WSS.
