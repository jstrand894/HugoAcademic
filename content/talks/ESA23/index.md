  Earned second place for my presentation titled "<i>Using organic volatile compounds to assess the relationship between wheat stem sawfly, parasitoids, and smooth brome</i>".

abstract: |
  Wheat stem sawfly, <i>Cephus cinctus</i> Norton (WSS), causes significant damage in cereal crops throughout the northern Great Plains of North America. WSS parasitoids (<i>Bracon cephi</i> and <i>Bracon lissogaster</i>) are an important factor in managing WSS outbreaks and damage. Previous research has shown smooth brome (<i>Bromus inermis</i> Leyss.) grass to be an effective WSS sink, and potential parasitoid source, when grown in areas surrounding wheat fields in Montana. However, the degree to which the parasitoids can utilize smooth brome as a temporally stable local refuge is unknown. Our objective was to identify and quantify the organic volatile compounds produced by WSS infested and uninfested smooth brome and winter wheat. By using electroantennogram and bioassay techniques, our goal is to then understand the response of WSS parasitoids smooth brome volatiles and contrast with the parasitoid response to winter wheat. We found increased levels of Î²-ocimene, nonanal, and <i>Z</i>-(3)-hexenyl acetate within smooth brome compared to winter wheat, and overall elevated quantities of volatile compounds within the infested plants. Our results suggest that smooth brome emits elevated but similar quantities of organic volatiles compared to winter wheat, allowing WSS parasitoids to locate WSS larva infested stems.
