summary: |
  I'll be participating in the 10-minute paper student competition with my talk titled "Agroecological importance of smooth brome in managing wheat stem sawfly (Hymenoptera: Cephidae) via its associated braconid parasitoids".

abstract: |
  Wheat stem sawfly, <i>Cephus cinctus</i> Norton (WSS), causes significant damage in cereal crops throughout the Northern Great Plains of North America. <i>Bracon cephi</i> and <i>Bracon lissogaster</i> are native WSS parasitoids important in managing WSS outbreaks and damage. Smooth Brome (<i>Bromus inermis</i> Leyss.) grass has been found to be an effective parasitoid sink, and potential trap crop, when grown in areas surrounding wheat fields in Montana. As climate changes continue to alter central and northern Montana, WSS will continue to cause immense damage to dry-land cereal crop yields. My study observes the utilization of smooth brome in providing year-over-year host refuge for Bracon spp. We measured the WSS larval survival rate within controlled smooth brome plots, observing a maximum end-of-year survival of 5.7%. We also collected stems from central and northern Montana where we measured the WSS infestation and parasitoid prevalence within cultivated wheat and adjacent smooth brome. Montana fields sites showed similar high year-end WSS larval mortality while showcasing high levels of parasitism. This research underlines the importance of providing a sustainable ecological buffer for WSS parasitoids as climate conditions continue to change.
